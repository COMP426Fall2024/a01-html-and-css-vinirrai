        <!-- Detailed information about Lord Hanuman's significance in Hinduism -->
        <p>
            Hanuman (/ˈhʌnʊˌmɑːn/; Sanskrit: हनुमान्, IAST: Hanumān), also known as Maruti, Bajrangabali, and Anjaneya,
            is a deity in Hinduism, revered as a divine vanara, and a devoted companion of the deity Rama. Central to
            the Ramayana, Hanuman is celebrated for his unwavering devotion to Rama and is considered a chiranjivi. He is
            traditionally believed to be the spiritual offspring of the wind deity Vayu, who is said to have played a significant role
            in his birth. In Shaiva tradition, he is regarded as an incarnation of Shiva, while in most of the Vaishnava traditions,
            he is the son and incarnation of Vayu. His tales are recounted not only in the Ramayana but also in the Mahabharata and
            various Puranas.
